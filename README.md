# FlaskWeatherPredictionAPI

A Python Flask app that predicts weather using user-provided latitude and longitude by calling the OpenWeatherMap API. The server runs in the background and is exposed via ngrok, allowing real-time weather data retrieval through POST requests from any location.


FEATURES:

User input for latitude and longitude
Real-time weather data fetched from OpenWeatherMap
Ngrok tunnel setup for external access
Threaded background Flask server
